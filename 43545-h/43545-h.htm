<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Because of the recent agitation of the pure food question
throughout the country, health officers, food-inspectors,
and chemistry teachers and students are constantly called
upon to test the purity of various foods. And this usually
involves nothing more than making simple qualitative tests
for adulterants. In view of the fact that there is now no
text or manual devoted exclusively to the qualitative examination
of foods, this little book is offered to those who are
interested in this work.</p>

<p>Its aim is to bring together in one small book the best and
simplest qualitative tests for all the common food adulterants.
It contains a brief statement of the adulterants
likely to be found and the reason for their use. It is hoped
that it will be specially valuable to chemistry teachers in
furnishing excellent supplementary work in qualitative
analysis. But it is hoped that it will find its greatest usefulness
in contributing something toward the great pure
food reform.</p>

<p>It is impossible to make due mention of all the sources
from which these various tests have been collected, but
where possible, the author&#8217;s name has been associated with
the test.</p>

<p class="center fsize200">PURE FOOD TESTS</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="chapname">DAIRY PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<h3>MILK</h3>

<p>Milk is adulterated by watering, removing the cream or
by adding some foreign substance. Formaldehyde, boric
acid or salicylic acid may be added to preserve the milk.
Annatto, caramel or some coal-tar dye is added, sometimes
to improve the color of the milk, and at other times to cover
up traces of watering. Gelatin and starch are added for
the same purpose, though they are not frequently used.</p>

<h3>ARTIFICIAL COLORING MATTER</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Annatto</span></h4>

<p>Add acid sodium carbonate to a sample of the milk
until it shows a slight alkaline reaction. Immerse a
piece of filter-paper and leave it in for 12 or 15 hours. If
annatto is present, there will be a reddish-yellow stain on
the paper.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Caramel</span></h4>

<p><i>Leach&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Warm 150 cc. of the sample and add
5 cc. of acetic acid, then continue heating it nearly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
boiling point, stirring while it is being heated. Separate
the curd by gathering it with the stirring rod or by pouring
through a sieve. Press out all the whey from the curd and
macerate the latter for several hours (10 to 12 hours) in
50 cc. of ether. It is best to do this in a tightly corked
flask, shaking it frequently. If the milk was uncolored or
colored with annatto the curd when thus treated will be
white. If the curd is a dull brown color caramel was probably
used to color the milk. Confirm its presence by shaking
a portion of the curd with concentrated hydrochloric
acid (sp. gr. 1.20) and gently heating. If the acid solution
turns blue while the curd does not change its color, caramel
was used to color the milk. (Remember that the ether-extracted
curd must be brown.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coal Tar Colors</span></h4>

<p><i>Lythgoe&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Mix in a porcelain vessel about
15 cc. each of the sample of milk and hydrochloric acid
(sp. gr. 1.20) and break up the curd into coarse lumps by
shaking gently. If an azo-color was used to color the milk
this curd will be pink, but the curd of normal milk will be
white or yellowish.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Starch</span></h4>

<p>The presence of starch in milk may be detected by heating
a small quantity of the milk to boiling. When it has cooled
add a drop of iodin in potassium iodid, and if starch is
present there will be a blue coloration.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gelatin</span></h4>

<p><i>A. W. Stokes&#8217; Method.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 1 part by weight of
mercury in 2 parts of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42). Add 24
times this volume of water. Mix equal volumes (about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
10 cc.) of this reagent and the milk or cream, shake well
and add 20 cc. of water. Shake again and, after standing
5 minutes, filter. When a great quantity of gelatin is present
the filtrate will be opalescent instead of perfectly clear.
To a little of this filtrate in a test tube add the same volume
of a saturated aqueous solution of picric acid. If much
gelatin is present a yellow precipitate is produced, smaller
amounts produce a cloudiness. If the filtrate is perfectly
clear gelatin is absent and picric acid may be added without
producing any noticeable effect.</p>

<h3>PRESERVATIVES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Formaldehyde</span></h4>

<p><i>Hehner&#8217;s Sulfuric Acid Test.</i>&mdash;Put 10 cc. of the suspected
milk in a wide test tube and pour carefully down the
side of the inclined tube about 5 cc. commercial sulfuric
acid so that it forms a separate layer at the bottom. A
violet coloration at the union of the two liquids indicates
the presence of formaldehyde. If the commercial acid is
not available, the pure acid may be used, but a few drops
of ferric chloride must be added. Sometimes the charring
effect of the acid makes it advisable to use the following
test:</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric Acid Test.</i>&mdash;2 cc. of 10 per cent ferric
chloride is added to one liter of commercial hydrochloric
acid sp. gr. 1.2 (or any quantity in this proportion). To
10 cc. of this mixture add 10 cc. of the milk to be tested.
Heat the mixture slowly nearly to the boiling point, in an
evaporating dish, but agitating it all the while to prevent
the curd collecting in one mass. If formaldehyde is present,
there will be a violet coloration. It is said that by this test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as small a quantity of formaldehyde as 1 part in 250,000
parts of milk can be detected. It is not so sensitive in sour
milk.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Boric Acid</span></h4>

<p><i>Turmeric Paper Test.</i>&mdash;Incinerate some of the milk,
and acidulate the ash with a very few drops of dilute hydrochloric
acid and afterwards dissolve it in a few drops of
water. Place a strip of turmeric paper in this solution for
a few minutes, then remove and dry it. If boric acid either
free or combined is present, the turmeric paper will be
turned to a cherry-red color.</p>

<p><i>Another way of making this test.</i>&mdash;U. S. Dep. of Agr.,
Div. of Chem., Bul. 65, p. 110: Make strongly alkaline with
lime water, 25 grams of the milk, and evaporate to dryness
on the water bath. Destroy the organic matter by igniting
the residue. Dilute with 15 cc. of water and acidify with
hydrochloric acid. Then add 1 cc. of the concentrated
acid. Dip a piece of delicate turmeric paper in the solution;
and if borax or boric acid is present, it will have a
characteristic red color when dry. Ammonia changes it
to a dark blue green, but the acid will restore the color.</p>

<p>(Turmeric paper may be prepared by dipping pieces of
smooth, thin filter paper in a solution of powdered turmeric
in alcohol.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Salicylic Acid</span></h4>

<p>(This is not often used as a preservative of milk.)</p>

<p><i>Leach suggests the following method for its detection.</i>&mdash;Dissolve
one gram of mercury in 2 grams of nitric acid (sp.
gr. 1.42) and then add to the solution the same volume of
water. Add 1 cc. of this reagent to 50 cc. of the milk to be
tested, and shake and filter. The perfectly clear filtrate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
shaken with ether and the ether extract evaporated to dryness.
Then add a drop of ferric chlorid solution, and a
violet color will be produced if salicylic acid is present.</p>

<h3>BUTTER</h3>

<p>Butter is often colored with annatto, saffron, turmeric,
marigold or coal-tar colors. By a certain process, stale or
old butter is sometimes worked over and made to appear
fresh for a time. This is sold under the name of &#8220;process&#8221;
or &#8220;renovated&#8221; butter. Foreign fats like cottonseed oil,
sesame oil, or oleomargarine may be substituted for or
added to pure butter.</p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER</h3>

<p><i>Martin&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Add 2 parts of carbon bisulfid, a little
at a time and with frequent shaking, to 15 parts of alcohol.
Shake 25 cc. of this solution with 5 grams of the butter, and
let stand for some time. The carbon bisulfid dissolves out
the fatty matter and settles to the bottom. The alcohol
remains on top and will dissolve out any artificial colors
that may be present. If only a little coloring matter is
present use more of the butter.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Annatto</span></h4>

<p>Evaporate a portion of the extract to dryness and add
sulfuric acid to the residue. If annatto is present a greenish-blue
color forms. Should a pink tint result the presence of
a coal-tar color is to be suspected.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coal-Tar Colors</span></h4>

<p>These colors will dye wool or silk if pieces of the fiber are
boiled in the diluted alcoholic extract, which has first been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
acidified with hydrochloric acid. The normal butter coloring
matter will not dissolve when thus treated.</p>

<p><i>Geisler&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;To a few drops of the clarified fat on
a porcelain surface, add a very little fullers&#8217; earth. If a
pink to violet-red coloration is produced in a short time the
presence of an azo-color is indicated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Saffron</span></h4>

<p>When saffron is present, nitric acid colors the alcoholic
extract green, and hydrochloric acid colors it red.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Turmeric</span></h4>

<p>Add ammonia to the alcoholic extract, and if it turns brown
it indicates the presence of turmeric.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Marigold</span></h4>

<p>Add silver nitrate to the extract, and if it turns black the
presence of marigold is indicated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Process or Renovated Butter</span></h4>

<p>Heat a little of the suspected butter in a spoon or dish, and
if it is process butter it will sputter, but not foam much.
Make the test also with some butter known to be pure and
fresh.</p>

<p><i>Hess and Doolittle Test.</i>&mdash;Melt some of the butter (say
40 grams) at about 50&deg; C. If the butter is pure and fresh
the melted fat will clear up almost as soon as it is melted,
while the fat of process butter remains turbid for quite
a while. After most of the curd has settled, decant as
much as possible of the fat. Pour the remainder on a wet
filter. Add a few drops of acetic acid to the water that runs
through from the filter, and boil. If it was ordinary butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
this filtrate will become milky, but if process butter a flocculent
precipitate will form.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Oleomargarine</span></h4>

<p>Immerse a test tube, containing some of the filtered fat,
in boiling water for 2 minutes. Make a mixture of 1 part
glacial acetic acid, 6 parts ether, and 4 parts alcohol. Add
to 20 cc. of this mixture in a 50 cc. test tube, 1 cc. of the
heated fat which may be transferred by means of a hot
pipette. Stopper the tube and shake it well. Immerse
in water at 15&deg; or 16&deg; C. Pure butter when thus treated
remains clear for quite a while. There will be only a very
little deposit after standing an hour, but oleomargarine
gives a deposit almost immediately, and in a few minutes
there will be a copious precipitate.</p>

<p>When the oleomargarine in butter is in about the proportion
of 1&nbsp;: 10, it will not separate much short of 15
minutes.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cottonseed Oil</span></h4>

<p>The presence of this oil may be detected by Halpen&#8217;s
test, which is given under lard, page 60.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="chapname">MEATS AND EGGS</span></h2>

<p>Meats are preserved by treating them with potassium
nitrate, boric acid, sulfurous acid, salicylic acid, or benzoic
acid. Cheap meat may be substituted for the more expensive.
A few cases of horse meat in mince meat and
sausages have been discovered. Diseased and stale meats
have been found on the market. Canned meats often contain
zinc, tin, and lead, and sometimes even arsenic. Aniline-red
or cochineal-carmine may be added to improve the
color of chopped or ground meats. Starch is sometimes
added to sausage and similar meat. Fish and oysters may
be preserved with boric acid or borax.</p>

<h3><a name="SecRef01" id="SecRef01"></a>FRESH AND SMOKED PRODUCTS&mdash;PRESERVATIVES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter)</span></h4>

<p>Corned and smoked meats are usually preserved with
saltpeter. Since smoked and cured meats are used in
making potted meats, saltpeter is quite frequently found in
the latter. It may be detected by the usual test for nitrates
since no other nitrate is apt to be present, though one may
identify the metal by the qualitative test for potassium.</p>

<p>To test for nitrates treat a little of the meat with 2 or 3 cc.
of a 1 per cent solution of diphenylamine in strong sulfuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
acid. If a nitrate is present a deep blue color forms instantly,
which is not obscured by the charring effect of the
acid.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Boric Acid</span></h4>

<p>Pick apart into fine pieces about 25 or 50 grams of the
lean meat and warm with a little water which has a few drops
of hydrochloric acid in it. Soak a piece of turmeric paper
in the extract, and if boric acid is present the paper will be
colored rose-red when it is dry. A weak alkali turns this
colored paper olive.</p>

<p>Another method is to burn a piece of the meat to an ash,
after being treated with lime water. Make a solution of
the ash and make slightly acid with hydrochloric acid.
Then test with the turmeric paper with the same results as
in the above method.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sulfurous Acid</span></h4>

<p>U. S. Dep. Agr., Bureau Chem., Bul. 13, Part 10: Digest
40 or 50 grams of the meat in hot water, treat with
10 cc. glacial phosphoric acid to coagulate the proteids.
Strain through a cotton bag and transfer the filtrate to a
short-necked flask and distil receiving the first part of the
distillate in a solution of iodin. Boil, and add barium
chloride. If sulfurous acid is present, it will be oxidized
to sulfuric acid and precipitated as barium sulfate by the
barium chlorid. More than a mere trace of the precipitate
proves that some sulfite was used to preserve the meat.</p>

<p>Another method suggested by K&auml;mmerer is to place the
meat on paper, which has been saturated with potassium
iodate moistened with dilute sulfuric acid (1&nbsp;: 8); nitric oxid
must not be present. If sulfurous acid is present a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
blue color forms at once. A trace of this color may form
after some time with meat that is not fresh, hence this
method cannot be used in examining canned meat.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Salicylic Acid</span></h4>

<p>Heat 50 grams of the meat in 50 cc. of water. Add 10 cc.
of a strong solution of glacial phosphoric acid and strain
through a cotton bag. Extract the filtrate with a little
ether (about 50 cc.) in a separatory funnel. Let the ether
evaporate spontaneously. Take up the residue with 3 cc.
of water, and add one or two drops of a one-half per cent
solution of ferric chlorid. If salicylic acid is present the
mixture will be purple or violet.</p>

<p>Leach makes the same test by slightly acidifying a portion
of the lean meat, then extracting with ether, and evaporating
to dryness and testing the residue with a drop of
ferric chlorid solution. A deep violet coloration is produced
if salicylic acid is present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Benzoic Acid</span></h4>

<p><i>Mohler&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Prepare a sample as in the test for
salicylic acid by heating 50 grams of the meat in 50 cc. of
water. Add 10 cc. of a concentrated solution of glacial
phosphoric acid, and strain through a cotton bag. Neutralize
with sodium hydrate and evaporate to dryness or to
a small volume. After treating with 3 cc. of concentrated
sulfuric acid, heat till white fumes appear. Add 4 or 5 crystals
of potassium nitrate and continue heating until the solution
is colorless or nearly so. When cool dilute with water,
add an excess of ammonia, and place in a narrow vessel like
a test tube. Add one or two drops of ammonium sulfid
carefully so that the liquids do not mix. If the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the liquid immediately becomes red, benzoic acid is
present.</p>

<p>If this test is not carefully performed, it is worthless, as
other substances give similar results.</p>

<p>Confirm its presence by neutralizing the aqueous solution
of the extracted benzoic acid with sodium hydroxid; concentrate
to a very small volume. Acidify with sulfuric
acid. A white flocculent precipitate shows the presence of
considerable benzoic acid.</p>

<h3>CANNED MEAT</h3>

<p>If in preparing canned meat only fresh meat is used, there
is little need for the use of preservatives, but as considerable
smoked and cured meat is thus used, preservatives may
find their way into canned meat.</p>

<p>The same preservatives should be looked for as in fresh
and smoked meat and the same test made for each.</p>

<h4><a name="SecRef04" id="SecRef04"></a><span class="smcap">Heavy Metals</span></h4>

<p><i>A. H. Allen&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;About 25 grams of the substance
is mixed slowly with enough strong, pure sulfuric acid to
just moisten the mass, avoiding an excess. Heat on a
water-bath for a short time, then raise the temperature
gradually, and maintain till the chlorids seem to be decomposed.
It must not be hot enough, however, to volatilize
the sulfuric acid. Then add 1 cc. of strong nitric acid and
heat till red fumes are given off. Freshly ignited magnesia
in the proportion of 0.5 gram for each cc. of sulfuric and
nitric acid previously used is now stirred into the mass and
the whole ignited at a dull red heat. This is best done in a
gas-muffle. When cool, moisten the ash with nitric acid
and gently re-ignite, repeating this treatment till the carbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is entirely consumed. Treat the residue with 8 or 10 drops
of strong sulfuric acid, heat till fumes are given off, cool,
boil with water, dilute to about 100 cc. and saturate with
hydrogen sulfid, filter, examine as follows:</p>

<table summary="Table page 12">

<tr class="btd bb">
<td colspan="2" class="left top padr1 brd">Zinc and iron may be in solution. Add bromine water to destroy hydrogen sulfid and to oxidize

<h3>FISH SALT DRIED AND OYSTERS</h3>

<p>This kind of meat is often preserved with boric acid and
borax. They may be detected by the method given under
<a href="#SecRef01">fresh and smoked meat</a>.</p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER</h3>

<p>Sausages and other chopped meat preparations, together
with corned meat that has been cured without saltpeter,
are often treated with artificial coloring matter.</p>

<p>Aniline red and cochineal carmine are usually employed
for this purpose. The former may be detected, according
to Allen, by picking the meat apart and treating it with
methylated spirit, strain or filter the extract and take up
with water. Then a piece of white wool (nun&#8217;s veiling will
do) is immersed in the boiling liquid and, if it is dyed red,
rosaniline is present.</p>

<p>Cochineal-carmine may be detected by the method used
by Klinger and Bujard. Cut up fine about 20 grams of
the meat and heat in a water-bath with water and glycerine
mixed in equal parts. If the above coloring matter is
present the liquid will become quite red in color, if not
present a slight yellow color results from this treatment.
If a spectroscope is available this dye is easily recognized.</p>

<h3>STARCH</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">In Sausage, Deviled Meat, and Similar Products</span></h4>

<p>Cracker and bread crumbs are often added to these
preparations and their presence is best detected by examining
the amount of starch present. Do this by boiling some
of the sample in water, and when cool adding a drop or two
of iodin reagent. The usual blue color is produced if much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
starch is present. If there is only a little starch, it may be
necessary to examine it under the microscope to determine
whether the starch is from the pepper and other spices used
or from some cereal.</p>

<h3>DISEASED MEAT</h3>

<p><i>The following method is recommended by Ebers.</i>&mdash;Hold a
small piece of the suspected meat over a mixture of 1 cc.
hydrochloric acid, 3 cc. alcohol, and 1 cc. of ether. The
formation of ammonium chlorid fumes shows that decomposition
has begun. Do not mistake the fumes of the acid
for those of ammonium chlorid.</p>

<h3>HORSE FLESH</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">In Sausage and Mince Meat</span></h4>

<p>This sophistication is not common in this country. Horse
flesh is detected by testing for glycogen, which is present in
it in larger quantities than in other meats.</p>

<p><i>Courley &amp; Coremon&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Boil 50 grams of the meat
for a half hour with water, strain, and to a portion of the
filtrate add a few drops of potassium iodid-iodin solution
(potassium iodid 0.4 gram; iodin 0.1 gram; water 20 cc.).
If considerable horse meat is present the glycogen will color
the liquid dark brown, which disappears on heating, but
returns on cooling.</p>

<h3>EGGS</h3>

<p>It sometimes happens that one wishes to know the age of
eggs without opening them.</p>

<p><i>Delarne&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Place the egg in a 10 per cent solution
of common salt. Perfectly fresh eggs sink to the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Those remaining immersed, but suspended in the liquid, are
at least three days old, while those rising to the surface and
floating are more than five days old. The older the egg,
the higher it floats and the more it will stand on end. This
test is not applicable to eggs that have been preserved.</p>

<p>Hold the egg between a bright light and the eye, and if
the air chamber is small, and no dark spots but instead a
rather uniform rose-colored tint is seen, the egg is fresh.
If the contents appear cloudy and the air chamber larger,
the egg is not fresh. The darker the contents of the egg
the older it is.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="chapname">CEREAL PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<h3>FLOUR</h3>

<p>Sometimes a cheaper or inferior grade of flour is substituted
for one of higher quality, and even a different kind
of flour may be substituted, as corn meal in wheat flour, or
wheat in rye flour. Alum may be added by millers to cover
up traces of bad flour, and by bakers to make the bread
white when a bad or cheap flour is being used. Copper
sulfate also may be added to improve the appearance.
Occasionally rye flour is made from rye upon which ergot
has developed. Stannous chlorid and potassium carbonate
are added to ginger cake to give the same color to the
product made of molasses and a poor grade of flour as that
made from good flour and honey.</p>

<h3>ALUM</h3>

<p><i>Wynther Blyth Method.</i>&mdash;Add a little water to the sample
and macerate. Soak pieces of gelatin in the solution and
leave for a half day, remove the gelatin and dip the pieces
in a mixture of equal volumes of a fresh tincture of logwood
and a saturated solution of ammonium carbonate. The
gelatin strips will turn blue if alum is present.</p>

<p><i>Bell &amp; Carter Method.</i>&mdash;Make a fresh 5 per cent tincture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of logwood in methyl alcohol. Dampen about 10 grams
of the flour with water and add 1 cc. of the logwood tincture
and the same quantity of a saturated solution of ammonium
carbonate. Pure flour gives a pinkish color which fades to
buff or brown. The presence of alum produces a lavender
or bluish tint which becomes more distinct as it dries.</p>

<h3><a name="SecRef02" id="SecRef02"></a>COPPER SULFATE</h3>

<p>This adulterant may be detected in either flour or bread,
by soaking the flour or bread in a dilute solution of potassium
ferrocyanid acidulated with acetic acid. If copper be
present a purplish or reddish-brown coloration will be produced.</p>

<h3>SUBSTITUTED FLOURS</h3>

<p><i>Vogel&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Make a mixture of alcohol (70 per
cent), 95 parts, hydrochloric acid 5 parts. Treat a sample
of the flour in a test tube with this reagent. Shake well.
Heat to boiling and allow to settle. A colorless fluid shows
the flour to be pure, a straw-colored tint indicates the presence
of gruffs with bran, an orange-yellow proves the presence
of corn-cockle flour, a flesh-colored liquid indicates
the presence of ergot, while a green color indicates buckwheat
flour.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Corn Meal in Wheat Flour</span></h4>

<p><i>Kraemer claims to be able to detect as small amount as 5
per cent of maize in wheat flour, by the following test.</i>&mdash;Mix
a gram of the flour with 15 cc. of good glycerin, and heat to
boiling for a short time. If corn meal is present, there will
be an odor like that of pop corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wheat in Rye Flour</span></h4>

<p><i>Kleeburg recommends the following test.</i>&mdash;A little of the
flour is mixed on a piece of common window glass or microscope
slide, with sufficient water (at 45&deg; C.) to float the
flour particles. Spread the mixture out over the glass, and
press another glass down upon it. When wheat flour is
present, white spots will be seen, and if the glasses are slid
upon each other the spots will pull out into threads, and
the thicker and longer they are the more wheat flour there
is present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ergot in Rye Flour</span></h4>

<p><i>Boettger gives the following chemical test for ergot.</i>&mdash;Heat
10 to 15 minutes with an equal quantity of ether, adding a
few crystals of oxalic acid. When ergot is present a reddish
color develops.</p>

<p><i>Another Method.</i>&mdash;Bul. 51, Bureau of Chem.</p>

<p>Digest 20 grams of the suspected flour, with boiling
alcohol, till no more color is extracted. Add 1 cc. of sulfuric
acid (1&nbsp;: 3), and if ergot is present the solution will be
colored red.</p>

<h3>BREAD</h3>

<h4>ALUM</h4>

<p>Moisten a piece of the bread with water, and then with a
logwood solution (5 grams logwood digested in 100 cc. of
alcohol). If alum is present the bread will become lavender
blue in two or three hours. Pure bread would have a
red-brown tint. To prove the presence of alum, the blue
color must be permanent at the temperature of boiling
water. (The logwood used in this test must be pure.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Blyth&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Macerate 150 grams of the sample for
45 or 50 hours in a couple liters of water; after straining
through muslin, evaporate to a small volume over a low
flame. Immerse a strip of gelatin in this liquid, and then
in a logwood solution (same as in last test), and if alum is
present it will acquire the lavender color.</p>

<p>If the bread in either of these tests is sour, the following
modification (Vanderplanken) must be made. Reduce 15
grams of the sample to a paste with water and some pure
chlorid of sodium, adding 10 drops of a fresh alcoholic
solution of logwood, after which add 5 grams of pure potassium
carbonate. Mix well, and after washing with 100 cc.
of water into a vessel allow to settle. If alum is present
the liquid will soon become reddish-violet, and if not present
it will be blue.</p>

<h3>COPPER SULFATE</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">See Test for <a href="#SecRef02">Copper Sulfate in Flour</a></span></p>

<h3>GINGER CAKE</h3>

<p>Tin may be detected by the method for heavy metals
under meat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="chapname">LEAVENING MATERIALS</span></h2>

<h3>BAKING POWDERS</h3>

<p>Baking powders consist of bicarbonate of soda and an
acidifying agent as acid potassium tartrate, acid calcium
phosphate, tartaric acid or alum. Some powders contain
both acid calcium phosphate and alum. The kind of
powder is determined by testing for these. Gypsum has
been added to baking powders to increase the weight.</p>

<h3>TARTARIC ACID</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Free or Combined</span></h4>

<p><i>Wolff&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;If no starch is present, mix a little of
the powder with some dry resorcin. Add a few drops of
sulfuric acid and heat gently. A rose-red color forms if
tartaric acid or tartrates are present. The color should
disappear when diluted with water. When starch is present,
mix well by shaking about 5 grams of the powder with
250 cc. of cold water. Let the insoluble matter settle and
pour the liquid upon a filter. Evaporate the filtrate to
dryness, treat the powdered residue with a few drops of a
1 per cent solution of resorcin. Add 3 cc. of strong sulfuric
acid, heat slowly. A rose-red color forms if tartaric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is present. The color should be destroyed on the addition
of water. This test is applicable in the presence of phosphates
and the acid may be free or combined.</p>

<h3>TARTARIC ACID</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Free</span></h4>

<p>Make an absolute alcoholic extract of 5 grams of the
powder and evaporate the alcohol. Add sufficient dilute
ammonia to dissolve the residue, place in a test tube and
drop in a crystal or two of silver nitrate. Heat gently, and
a silver mirror will form if tartaric acid is present.</p>

<h3>SULFATES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Calcium, etc.</span></h4>

<p>Boil a portion of the sample gently with strong hydrochloric
acid, add barium chlorid. A white precipitate of
barium sulfate will form if sulfuric acid is present.</p>

<h3>GYPSUM</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Calcium Sulfate</span></h4>

<p>Ash a portion of the sample and make the usual qualitative
tests for calcium sulfate.</p>

<h3>AMMONIUM SALTS</h3>

<p>Extract a few grams of the sample with cold water, boil
the extract with sodium hydroxid and place a piece of
moist red litmus paper in the steam. It will be colored
blue if ammonia is present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALUM</h3>

<p>Reduce to an ash about 2 grams of the powder in a platinum
dish. Extract with boiling water, add ammonium
chlorid solution to the filtrate until a distinct odor of ammonia
is given off.</p>

<p>If a flocculent precipitate forms it indicates the presence
of alum.</p>

<p>This test for alum is applicable in the presence of phosphates.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Richards.</i>&mdash;Cover some logwood chips (they must
be pure) with water and bring to a boil. Repeat this four
times, saving only the last decoction. Shake some of the
sample (a couple of teaspoonfuls) in a beaker half full of
water. When it ceases effervescing, strongly acidify with
acetic acid. Add a few drops of the logwood extract, and
if alum is present a bluish-red color will appear.</p>

<h3>CREAM OF TARTAR</h3>

<p>Cream of tartar is bitartrate of potassium and is obtained
from the lees deposited in wine casks. If gypsum
has been used to clarify the wine, it will be present in the
cream of tartar as calcium tartrate.</p>

<p>Other adulterants of cream of tartar are acid calcium
phosphate, starch, gypsum, and alum.</p>

<h3>TARTARIC ACID</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Free or Combined</span></h4>

<p>If the sample is known to be free from starch the following
test may be made:</p>

<p>Mix a bit of the powder with a small quantity of dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
resorcin and add a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid.
Heat slowly, and if a rose-red color forms, which disappears
when diluted with water, there is present either
tartaric acid or a tartrate.</p>

<p>When the sample contains starch, shake about 4 or 5
grams of it a number of times with 250 cc. of cold water
in a large flask. Pour on a filter after the insoluble material
has settled and evaporate the filtrate to dryness. The
residue is to be tested for tartaric acid and tartrates, the
same as when starch was absent.</p>

<h3>ALUMINIUM SALTS</h3>

<p>Mix equal quantities (about 1 gram) of the sample and
sodium carbonate and burn to an ash. Extract with boiling
water and filter. Add to this filtrate enough ammonium
chlorid solution to cause a distinct evolution of ammonia.
The formation of a flocculent precipitate shows the presence
of aluminium. This test may be used when phosphates
are present.</p>

<h3>AMMONIA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Present in the Form of Ammonia Alum or Ammonium
Carbonate</span></h4>

<p>Make a cold water extract of the powder and boil it with
sodium hydroxid. Test the steam with moist red litmus
paper.</p>

<h3>EARTHY MATERIALS</h3>

<p>Treat the sample with warm potassium hydroxid. A
residue indicates some earthy material.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="chapname">CANNED AND BOTTLED VEGETABLES</span></h2>

<p>No class of foods on the market has less need for antiseptics
than canned goods, yet their use is rather common.
Products thus treated are easier canned and are not so apt
to spoil. The chemicals used as preservatives are sulfurous
acid, and the sulfites, salicylic acid and saccharin, benzoic
acid, and sometimes formaldehyde. Sulfurous acid is
used to bleach such foods as canned corn. Saccharin
possesses some antiseptic properties, but its main use is as
a sweetener. Alum is used to make pickles hard and crisp.</p>

<p>Some canned or bottled goods, as tomato-catsup, is colored
with cochineal or coal-tar dyes. Green pickles, beans,
peas, and such vegetables are colored by copper salts or
are cooked in copper vessels, with the addition of acetic
acid, hence the beautiful green color. Turmeric is sometimes
used to color mixed pickles.</p>

<p>The heavy metals as lead, zinc, and tin are generally
present in canned goods, the amount varying with the corrosive
power of the vegetable.</p>

<p>When there is a year of scarcity in corn, peas, beans, and
such vegetables, the dried product is often soaked and
canned. Some of this goods is sold for the regular green
vegetable, while some may be properly marked &#8220;Soaked
Goods.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h3>PRESERVATIVES</h3>

<p>It is best to make a systematic examination for the different
preservatives. The sample may be prepared by mixing
50 grams of the pulped material with sufficient water in a
250 cc. graduated flask. Add phosphoric acid till distinctly
acid in reaction. Fill to the mark with water. Place in a
distilling flask, and distil in a linseed oil or a paraffin bath
till 30 cc. have been collected. Save this distillate for the
following tests.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Formaldehyde</span></h4>

<p>To 5 cc. of the above distillate in a test tube, add 2 or 3
drops of a 1 per cent aqueous solution of phenol and mix
well. Incline the tube and carefully pour down the side
5 cc. of concentrated commercial sulfuric acid so that the
two liquids do not mix. If formaldehyde is present there
will be a crimson zone at the plane of union of the solutions.
This coloration takes place when the formaldehyde is
present in the proportion of 1 part in 100,000 parts. When
there is a greater quantity of formaldehyde present a white
turbidity or a light-colored precipitate forms above the
coloring.</p>

<p><i>Phenylhydrazine Hydrochloric Test.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 2 grams
of phenylhydrazine hydrochlorid and 3 grams of sodium
acetate in 20 cc. of water. Add 2 to 4 drops of this reagent
and the same number of drops of sulfuric acid to 1 or 2
cc. of the above distillate, to be examined in a test tube. A
green coloration is produced when formaldehyde is present.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric Acid Test.</i>&mdash;Add 5 cc. of the distillate to
be tested to about 5 cc. of milk known to be pure, and about
10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.2) which
contains 1 cc. of a 10 per cent ferric chlorid solution to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
500 cc. of the acid. Heat slowly to 80&deg; or 90&deg; C. over the
free flame, agitating it at the same time to break up the
curd. A violet coloration indicates formaldehyde.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sulfurous Acid and the Sulfites</span></h4>

<p>Free sulfurous acid is not largely used as a food preservative,
though its salts are quite commonly employed.</p>

<p><i>Detection.</i>&mdash;Mix 150 grams of the finely ground sample
with enough water to make a thin paste. Acidify with
phosphoric acid and distil till 25 cc. have been collected.
(The delivery tube of the condenser should dip below the
surface of a little water.) Treat the distillate with a few
drops of bromine water and boil for a short time. If a
precipitate forms on the addition of barium chlorid the
presence of sulfurous acid is indicated.</p>

<h4><a name="SecRef03" id="SecRef03"></a><span class="smcap">Salicylic Acid</span></h4>

<p>Acidify 50 cc. of the sample with sulfuric acid, and shake
vigorously with 50 cc. of a mixture of equal parts of ether
and petroleum spirit. When the liquids have separated,
draw off as much as possible of the solvent and filter. If
an emulsion forms use a centrifugal machine, and evaporate
with a small flame. If needle-shaped crystals form, salicylic
acid is present. Add a few drops of water and a drop
of very dilute ferric chlorid solution in such a way that the
solutions will come together slowly. The presence of
salicylic acid gives a purple or violet color.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Saccharin</span></h4>

<p>This is used quite extensively as a sweetening agent in
canned sweet corn, and other similar products.</p>

<p>Macerate about 20 grams of the sample after mixing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
30 to 40 cc. of water and strain through muslin. Acidify
with 1 or 2 cc. of sulfuric acid (1 to 3) and extract with
ether. (If an emulsion forms, use a centrifugal machine.)
Separate the ether layer and let the ether evaporate spontaneously
and use the residue in the following tests:</p>

<p>Take up a part of the residue with water and taste. If it
is very sweet saccharin is present. Confirm by the following:</p>

<p><i>Schmidt&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Add about 1 gram of sodium hydroxide
to another part of the residue, and heat in an air-oven or
oil bath, for half an hour at about 250&deg; C., to convert the
saccharin into salicylic acid. After it has cooled, acidify
with sulfuric acid, extract and test for salicylic acid with
2 or 3 drops of ferric chlorid solution, letting the solutions
come together slowly. A purple or violet coloration proves
the presence of salicylic acid, which in turn indicates the
presence of saccharin. This test cannot be used if salicylic
acid was used as a preservative in the original product. A
test for the acid should first be made.</p>

<p><i>Bornstein&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Heat the remainder of the above
ether residue with resorcin and a very little sulfuric acid till
it begins to swell. (It is best to do this heating in a test-tube.)
Let cool till the action stops, heat again and repeat
the operation several times. After cooling the last
time, dilute with water and add sodium hydrate till
neutral. If saccharin is present, there will be a red-green
fluorescence.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Benzoic Acid</span></h4>

<p>Acidify 50 cc. of the sample with sulfuric acid and shake
vigorously with 50 cc. of a mixture of equal parts of ether
and petroleum spirit. Let the liquids separate, then draw
off as much as possible of the solvent and filter. (Use a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
centrifugal machine if an emulsion forms.) Separate the
extract into 2 parts and evaporate each to dryness over a
small flame and make the following tests:</p>

<p><i>Ferric Chlorid Test.</i>&mdash;Dissolve one of these residues in
ammonia, and evaporate to dryness on a water-bath. Take
up the residue with warm water, filter, and collect the filtrate
in a small test tube. Add a drop of ferric chlorid solution,
and if benzoic acid is present a characteristic flesh or brownish
colored precipitate of ferric benzoate forms. Sometimes
in such products as sweet pickles, a basic ferric acetate
precipitate comes down and the following test had better
be applied.</p>

<p><i>Peter&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Take about 0.1 gram of the second
part of the above ether residue, place in a large test tube
(about 50 cc.) and dissolve in 5 to 8 cc. of concentrated
sulfuric acid. Add from 0.5 to 0.8 gram of barium peroxide,
a little at a time. Shake each time and cool in water if
necessary. This should produce a permanent froth on
the sulfuric acid. Let stand 25 or 30 minutes, then fill the
tube three fourths full of water, shake and cool rapidly to
the temperature of the room, and filter off the barium
sulfate. Extract with chloroform or ether. Remove the
extract and test it for salicylic acid with dilute ferric chlorid.
(See first test under <a href="#SecRef03">salicylic acid</a>.) In this method salicylic
acid must first be proven absent.</p>

<p><i>Mohler&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Treat the remainder of the second part
of the above ether residue with 2 or 3 cc. of concentrated
sulfuric acid. Heat till white fumes appear. Add a few
crystals of potassium nitrate and when cool dilute with
water. Add an excess of ammonia, then a drop or two of
ammonium sulfid. If a red color appears immediately
on the surface, it shows the presence of benzoic acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER IN CATSUPS AND
TOMATOES</h3>

<h4><a name="SecRef05" id="SecRef05"></a><span class="smcap">Cochineal</span></h4>

<p><i>Girard and Dupre Test.</i>&mdash;Shake well a portion of the
sample with water and filter, acidify with hydrochloric acid,
then extract with amyl alcohol, and if cochineal is present
the extract will be colored yellow or orange, the particular
shade depending on the amount of cochineal present.
Remove the amyl alcohol and wash with water until it is
neutral. To half of this, add a very dilute solution of
uranium acetate, drop by drop, and shaking well after the
addition of each drop. Cochineal, if present, will produce
a characteristic emerald-green color.</p>

<p>Confirm by adding a drop or two of ammonia to the
second half of the amyl alcohol extract and a violet coloration
will be produced if cochineal is present.</p>

<h4><a name="SecRef07" id="SecRef07"></a><span class="smcap">Coal-Tar Coloring Matter</span></h4>

<p><i>Sostegni and Carpentieri Test.</i>&mdash;Free from grease a
piece of woolen cloth (nun&#8217;s veiling will do) by boiling first
in very dilute caustic soda solution and then in water.
Acidify a portion of the sample with 2 to 4 cc. of 10 per
cent solution of hydrochloric acid and filter. Strips of the
cleansed cloth are boiled in this filtrate for 5 or 10 minutes,
then removed, washed in water and boiled with very dilute
hydrochloric acid solution. Wash out the acid and dissolve
the color from the cloth by boiling in a solution of
ammonium hydroxid (1 to 50). (The time required will
depend upon the dye present.) Remove the cloth from
the solution and acidify the latter with hydrochloric acid
and another piece of the cleansed cloth is immersed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
again boiled. This second dyeing fixes only coal-tar colors
on the cloth, hence, no fear of mistaking them for the natural
color of the vegetable.</p>

<h3>IN GREEN PICKLES, BEANS, PEAS, ETC.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Copper Salts</span></h4>

<p>Burn 20 grams of the sample to an ash and wet the ash
with concentrated nitric acid, dilute with water and boil.
Add ammonia till strongly alkaline and filter. If the
filtrate is blue, copper is present.</p>

<p>Confirm by acidifying the filtrate with acetic acid and
adding potassium ferrocyanid. A red or brownish precipitate
or coloration proves the presence of copper. The
test for other heavy metals may be made by the <a href="#SecRef04">general
method</a> given under meats.</p>

<h3>IN MIXED PICKLES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Turmeric</span></h4>

<p>Shake with alcohol to extract the color. Soak a piece of
filter paper in the extract and dry in an air oven at 100&deg; C.
Wet the filter paper with a weak solution of boric acid to
which a very little hydrochloric acid has been added. If
turmeric is present, a cherry-red color will appear when the
filter paper is dry.</p>

<h3>&#8220;SOAKED&#8221; VEGETABLES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Peas, Beans, and Corn</span></h4>

<p>There is really no chemical test for this class of foods.
Certain helpful directions given in Bul. 65, p. 54, of the
Bureau of Chem., will assist in identifying such goods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
All or nearly all of the green color of peas and beans is
destroyed by the process of &#8220;soaking.&#8221; They have the
appearance of the well-matured product, and are firm and
mealy with well-formed cotyledons. The process of soaking
starts the growth of the caulicle of the pea. The kernel
of corn is plump and hard and does not have the milky
consistency of the immatured product. The characteristic
succulence of the green pea, bean, and corn is absent in the
soaked product.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Alum in Pickles</span></h4>

<p>This is sometimes added to the pickling solution to produce
hardness and crispness.</p>

<p>Burn to ash a sample of the pickles, and, if they are free
from copper, fuse in a platinum dish with sodium carbonate.
Extract with boiling water, and after filtering
add ammonium chlorid solution. If alum is present, a
flocculent precipitate will form.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Examination of the Can or Box in which Vegetables
are Sealed</span></h4>

<p>Generally when the ends of a can are convex, instead of
plane or concave, it is spoiled. In the souring of canned
sweet corn, it is exceptional that the ends are forced outward.</p>

<p>Strike the can and the spoiled cans will give a dull sound
while the good ones will give a distinct tone. Some practice
will be necessary to use this test.</p>

<p>One can judge of the amount of tin dissolved by the
corrosion of the inside of the can.</p>

<p>Reject cans that show much rust around the cap on the
inside of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>If more than one hole is found soldered in the cap, reject
the can. Cans of salmon are the only exception that has
come to the author&#8217;s notice. A second hole, in general,
indicates that decomposition had set in and the can had
been punctured and resealed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="chapname">FRUITS AND FRUIT PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<p>Salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and saccharin are used to
preserve fruits. The last is also added as a sweetener
instead of sugar. Many fruit products lose their color
with age, and to give them a lasting color they are treated
with a coal-tar dye, cochineal, acid magenta, or caramel.</p>

<p>A very small per cent of the jams and jellies sold are
strictly pure. These cheap products are made up principally
of apple juice and commercial glucose; artificial
essences are added to imitate the real flavor.</p>

<p>In cheap jellies made of apple juice and glucose syrup,
a &#8220;coagulator&#8221; is used; usually sulfuric acid and alum,
also citric and tartaric acids may be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Starch, gelatin, and agar are used as gelatinizing agents.</p>

<p>Fruits put up in tin cans may dissolve the heavy metals
as tin, zinc, lead, and even arsenic.</p>

<h3>PRESERVATIVES</h3>

<p><i>Preparation of the Sample.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 25 or 30 grams of
the sample in water which has been acidified with sulfuric
acid (1 to 3), then extract with ether, and remove the ether
layer and let it evaporate spontaneously. The residue
may contain salicylic acid, benzoic acid, or saccharin. Take
up with a little water and make the following tests:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Salicylic Acid</span></h4>

<p>Place a few drops of this extract in a test tube and add a
drop or two of a 0.5 per cent solution of ferric chlorid. If
salicylic acid is present, there will be a purple coloration.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Benzoic Acid</span></h4>

<p><i>Mohler&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Add 2 to 3 cc. of strong sulfuric acid to
a second portion of the above ether extract and heat until
white fumes appear. Then add a few crystals of potassium
nitrate and heat again. Continue adding the nitrate
and heating till the solution is colorless or only a very light
yellow. Dilute with about 5 cc. of water when cool,
neutralize with ammonia. It should be filtered when not
clear or when crystals of ammonium or potassium sulfate
are formed. Add a few drops of ammonium sulfid to the
filtrate in such a way as to prevent the mixing of the liquids.
The sulfid will be on top. If a bright cherry-red color
forms where the two liquids meet, either benzoic acid or
saccharin is present. Distil and the benzoic acid will pass
over, extract the distillate in the usual way and apply the
above test to it for benzoic acid.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Saccharin</span></h4>

<p>Taste a third portion of the ether extract. A very sweet
taste indicates saccharin. A further test can be made by
adding 1 or 2 grams of sodium hydroxid to the rest of the
ether extract and heating a half hour in an oil bath at
250&deg; C. Dissolve in water when cool, acidify with dilute
sulfuric acid and extract with ether. The saccharin will have
been converted into salicylic acid, which may be identified
by the usual test for that acid. This test presupposes the
absence of salicylic acid in the original material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER</h3>

<h4><a name="SecRef06" id="SecRef06"></a><span class="smcap">Coal-Tar Dyes</span></h4>

<p>To attempt to identify the particular dye used in every
case would be quite beyond the object of this set of simple
tests. A general test showing the presence of a coal-tar
dye is probably all that is usually desired.</p>

<p><i>Sostegni and Carpentieri Test.</i>&mdash;Such a test may be
made by dissolving 15 grams of the fruit product in 100 cc.
of water, filtering and acidifying with a small quantity of a
10 per cent solution of hydrochloric acid and again filtering.
Place in the filtrate strips of white woolen cloth (nun&#8217;s
veiling will do) which have been freed from grease by boiling
first in very dilute caustic soda solution, then in water,
and boil for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the cloth and wash
it in water, then boil in very dilute hydrochloric acid. Stir
the cloth in water to remove the acid and dissolve the color
by boiling in a solution of ammonium hydroxid (1 to 50).
The time required will depend upon the particular dye
used. Remove the cloth from the solution and acidify the
latter with hydrochloric acid, a slight excess is better, and
another piece of the cleansed cloth is immersed and again
boiled. Nothing but coal-tar dyes will color in this second
dyeing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cochineal</span></h4>

<p><i>Girard and Dupre Test.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#SecRef05">tests for cochineal</a> under
&#8220;Catsups and tomatoes.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Acid Magenta</span></h4>

<p><i>Girard and Dupre.</i>&mdash;Make about 100 cc. solution of the
fruit, filter, and neutralize with potassium hydroxid (strength
5 to 100); about 2 cc. will be needed. Add 4 cc. of mercuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
acetate solution (1 to 10), shake and filter. By this treatment
the filtrate should be colorless and slightly alkaline.
Add sulfuric acid till there is a slight excess. A colorless
solution indicates the absence of acid magenta, while a
light violet-red shows its presence, providing the amyl-alcohol
extract showed no other dye to be present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Caramel</span></h4>

<p><i>Amthor&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;10 cc. of a solution of the fruit is put
into a deep, narrow glass (a bottle may be used). Add 30
to 50 cc. of paraldehyde, to be gaged by the intensity of
the coloring. Then add a sufficient quantity of absolute
alcohol to make the solutions mix. If caramel is present,
a brownish-yellow to dark-brown precipitate will be formed,
decant, wash the precipitate once with absolute alcohol,
dissolve in a little hot water and filter. The shade of color
is proportional to the amount of caramel present.</p>

<p>To verify the test, pour the colored fluid into a freshly
prepared solution of phenylhydrazin (2 parts phenylhydrazin-hydrochlorid,
3 parts sodium acetate, and 20 parts
water). Much caramel produces a dark-brown precipitate
in the cold, and is hastened by slightly heating. A
very small amount of caramel will require several hours to
precipitate.</p>

<h3>APPLE-JUICE IN JELLIES MADE OF SMALL
FRUITS</h3>

<p>Very often cider is added to other fruit juices to give them
the proper consistency in jellies, jams, and marmalades.</p>

<p>Its presence may some times be determined by making the
usual starch test. A large quantity of starch is normally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
present in apples, but is less as they ripen, and finally disappears
in the ripened fruit. There is no starch, or only a
mere trace, in small fruits even when green. It is readily
seen that if the juice is taken from green apples that there
will be starch found in the artificial jelly or jam, though its
absence does not prove the absence of cider.</p>

<p>Make the starch test as follows:</p>

<h3>STARCH</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">In Jellies, Jams, and Such Products</span></h4>

<p>Make a solution of the jelly or jam and destroy the color
by heating nearly to the boiling point and adding dilute
(1&nbsp;: 3) sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate until
the color is destroyed. This treatment does not affect the
starch, and when cool add iodin, preferably potassium
iodid-iodin (potassium iodid, 0.4 gram; iodin, 0.1 gram;
water, 20 cc.). If a great quantity of starch is present an
almost black precipitate will be formed. Smaller amounts
give the usual blue color.</p>

<p>Whenever starch is found to be present, it is best to make
a microscopical examination in the case of jams and
marmalades. If the starch is normally present the grains
will be seen within the cell walls after the iodin treatment.</p>

<p>Starch is nearly always present in the apple and some
other fruits, so unless it is present in jelly and such products
in considerable quantity it is not likely that it was added.</p>

<h3>GELATIN</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">In Jellies</span></h4>

<p><i>Henzold Test.</i>&mdash;Add water to some of the jelly and boil
for a short time, filter and treat the filtrate with an excess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of a 10 per cent solution of potassium bichromate and boil
again. After cooling add 2 or 3 drops of concentrated
sulfuric acid. A white flocculent precipitate forms if
gelatin is present, and it gradually collects in a lump at the
bottom.</p>

<p><i>E. Beckmann&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Treat the jelly with 95 per
cent alcohol and wash the precipitate with alcohol to free
it from the sugar, then drive off the alcohol by heating.
Add a very little water to the residue and neutralize the
extract with calcium carbonate. Then add formalin and
evaporate to dryness. By this treatment gelatin is rendered
insoluble.</p>

<p>Pure fruit jellies have only 1 to 2 per cent of insoluble
precipitate, while those jellies in which gelatin is used have
70 to 86 per cent of insoluble precipitate.</p>

<h3>AGAR AGAR</h3>

<p>Boil the sample with 5 per cent sulfuric acid. Add a
crystal or two of potassium permanganate, and wait till it
settles, and examine the sediment for diatoms with a microscope.
Their presence shows the use of agar.</p>

<h3>HEAVY METALS</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tin, Zinc, Lead, and Copper</span></h4>

<p><i>A. H. Allen&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;(See <a href="#SecRef04">test for heavy metals</a>
under canned meat.)</p>

<h3>ARSENIC</h3>

<p><i>Marsh&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Fit a 100 cc. flask with a two-holed
rubber stopper, through which passes a long-stemmed
separatory funnel reaching nearly to the bottom, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
delivery tube which connects with a bulb tube containing
a little acetate of lead solution. This in turn is connected
with a calcium chlorid tube and this with a small, hard
glass tube, 15 or 20 cm. long, not over 0.5 cm. bore, and
drawn to small size in the middle. The large part next the
chlorid tube is protected by fine wire gauze which extends
to within a half inch of the constricted part. Two burners
may be so placed as to heat the gauze. The flask should
be placed in water and the bulb tube may be. Four grams
of arsenic-free zinc, and 40 cc. of dilute pure sulfuric acid
(1 to 8) are placed in the flask. Let the hydrogen flow at
least a quarter of an hour, then heat the gauze for 15 or 20
minutes. There should be no deposit in the tube. Now,
char a portion of the sample, dissolve in water and pour
into the separatory funnel, letting it run slowly into the
flask. A dark deposit in the glass tube shows that arsenic
is present, but if after an hour no darkening takes place it is
quite safe to say that no arsenic is present in the fruit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo048.png" alt="" width="500" height="238" />
<p class="caption">Apparatus for Marsh Test</p>
</div>

<p><i>Gutzeit&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Place a gram of pure zinc, 5 cc. of
dilute sulfuric acid (6 per cent) and about 1 cc. of a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the sample in a deep test tube. Cover the tube with
three thicknesses of filter paper, fitted tightly over the
mouth of the tube. Place on the upper paper a drop of
strong silver nitrate solution. Place the tube in a dark
place and leave for 10 minutes. If a bright yellow stain
forms on the filter paper, and turns black or brown when
water is added to it, arsenic is present. Unless one is
certain of the purity of the reagents used it is advisable to
make a blank test, using distilled water instead of the fruit.</p>

<p>Oxidize all sulfids to sulfates before applying the above
test. To find out whether they are present or not, substitute
lead acetate for the silver nitrate on the filter paper.
To avoid some of these difficulties treat according to the
following method:</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the sample according to Leach.</i>&mdash;If possible
reduce the sample to a dry char by treatment with
concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids so that it may be
powdered in a mortar. Dissolve out the arsenic by repeated
treatment with boiling water. Save this extract,
and, when cool, filter and submit to Marsh&#8217;s test which is
given above.</p>

<p>In case the sample is too much of a solid to get the arsenic
out by the above treatment, it may be prepared according
to the directions of Chittenden and Donaldson: Heat 100
grams of the macerated sample with 23 cc. of pure, strong
nitric acid to a temperature of 150&deg; C. or 160&deg; C. Assist
the action by stirring occasionally. When the fruit becomes
a deep yellow or orange color, remove the heat and add
3 cc. of pure, strong sulfuric acid. It should be stirred
while nitrous fumes are passing off. Heat again to about
180&deg; C., and before it cools add, drop by drop, 8 cc. of pure
concentrated nitric acid. It should be stirred constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
while the acid is being added. Heat at 200&deg; C. till sulfuric
acid fumes begin to come off and only a dry mass remains.
Powder the mass and exhaust it with boiling water, filter
and test the solution when cold with Marsh&#8217;s test.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="chapname">FLAVORING EXTRACTS</span></h2>

<h3>LEMON EXTRACT</h3>

<p>The important ingredients of lemon extract are lemon oil
and citral, its aromatic constituent. Oil of citronella and
oil of lemon grass are sometimes substituted for lemon oil.
Methyl alcohol is sometimes used in place of the more
expensive spirit alcohol as a solvent for the lemon oil.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lemon Oil</span></h4>

<p>The presence of lemon oil may be detected by adding a
large excess of water to a small amount of the extract in a
test tube. If the mixture does not show some cloudiness,
it is a strong indication that no lemon oil is present. The
degree of cloudiness gives an idea of the amount of oil
present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Citral</span></h4>

<p>This is present in the oil of lemon grass, which is sometimes
used as a substitute for lemon oil. Citral may be
detected by the following test by Burgess:</p>

<p>Add 20 cc. of sulfuric acid to 85 cc. of water. Dissolve
in this mixture 10 grams of mercuric sulfate. Shake 2 cc.
of the sample with 5 cc. of this reagent in a test tube. If
citral is present, the liquid will be bright red, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
quickly disappear and give place to a whitish compound,
which floats on top.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Oil of Citronella</span></h4>

<p>This is often substituted for lemon oil. It may be detected
by the same test which was used for citral. Instead
of the red color and the white compound, citronella gives a
bright yellow color, which does not disappear for some time.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tartaric or Citric Acid</span></h4>

<p>Precipitate the oil by the addition of an equal volume of
water. Filter and add a very little of the filtrate to a test
tube nearly full of cold lime water. A precipitate will
form if tartaric acid is present and it will dissolve in an
excess of ammonium chlorid or acetic acid. Filter, or, in
case no precipitate forms, heat the liquid. Citric acid is
precipitated in the presence of a large excess of hot lime
water.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Methyl Alcohol</span></h4>

<p><i>Mullikin and Scudder.</i>&mdash;Take 2 ft. of No. 12-15 copper
wire and bend at right angles about 8 or 10 inches from one
end. Grasp this bent end and an ordinary lead pencil
side by side in such a way that the bend will be about the
middle of the pencil. Wind the wire around the pencil
and toward the free end of the short part of the wire until
you have a coil 3 or 4 cm. long. Remove the pencil and
twist the unwound parts together for a handle for the coil.</p>

<p>Dilute a portion of the sample 3 or 4 times, and oxidize
10 cc. of the diluted liquid (preferably in a test tube) by
heating to a red heat the above copper coil in the oxidizing
flame of a Bunsen lamp. Thrust the heated coil quickly
into the liquid contained in the test tube. In a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
withdraw and immerse in water. Continue this operation
till the oxid of copper fails to be reduced (usually 4 or 5
times is sufficient). Cool the liquid by immersing the tube
in water. Separate into two parts and test each for formaldehyde
by the following methods:</p>

<p><i>Mullikin, S. P.</i>&mdash;Place one of these parts in an evaporating
dish, and add to it 1 cc. of strong ammonia, boil
gently over the free flame till the vapors cease to smell of
ammonia. Add 2 or 3 drops of strong hydrochloric acid
and heat just to boiling, and cool quickly by dipping the
dish in cold water. Make the test for formaldehyde: Add
a drop of a solution of resorcin (1&nbsp;: 200) and pour this mixture
slowly down the side of an inclined test tube which
contains 3 cc. of strong sulfuric acid, taking care to keep
the liquids separate. After 3 minutes give the tube a rotary
motion by rolling between the hands for a minute or more
but only gradually mixing the water and acid, but mixing
only about half of the acid.</p>

<p>Flecks of a rose-red color form if methyl alcohol is present.
Bands of color or flecks of other colors, even though they
be tinged with red or a rose-red solution without the precipitate,
should never be taken as proof that methyl alcohol
is present. These conditions, however, are good grounds
for repeating the test; 10 per cent or even less may be detected
by this test.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric Acid and Ferric Chlorid Test.</i>&mdash;Add a few
drops of the other part of the above oxidized liquid to about
10 cc. of milk, known to be free from formaldehyde, in a
porcelain casserole, and add 10 cc. of commercial hydrochloric
acid (sp. gr. 1.2) which contains 1 cc. of 10 per cent
ferric chlorid per 500 cc. Heat slowly over the open flame
nearly to boiling. Give the liquid a rotary motion to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
up the curd. If formaldehyde is present, the liquid will
be colored violet. If not, it slowly turns brown. The
presence of formaldehyde proves that methyl alcohol was
in the original extract.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coloring Matter</span></h4>

<p><i>Preliminary Test.</i>&mdash;Treat the sample with strong hydrochloric
acid, and if trop&aelig;olin or methyl orange be present the
solution will turn pink; Martius yellow partially decolorizes
the solution; dinitrocresols decolorizes the solution.
Turmeric or naphthol yellow produces no color change.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Turmeric</span></h4>

<p>Turmeric may be detected by soaking a piece of filter
paper in the sample, drying and dipping it in a dilute solution
of boric acid or borax which has been slightly acidulated
with hydrochlorid acid. Dry again and a cherry-red
color forms if turmeric is present. Add a drop of dilute
alkali and if turmeric be present the paper will be colored
dark olive.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coal-Tar Colors</span></h4>

<p>Evaporate some of the extract to dryness; take up the
residue with water and extract the coal-tar colors if present,
and test for them by the <a href="#SecRef06">method</a> given under canned vegetables.</p>

<h3>VANILLA EXTRACTS</h3>

<p>The best grades of vanilla extract are made by treating
vanilla beans with 50 per cent alcohol. Coumarin, an
extract from tonka beans, may be used in making the extract.
This of course would make a cheaper product. If
less than 50 per cent alcohol is used in making the extract,
some alkali must be added to dissolve the resins which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not dissolve in a weaker alcohol. In artificial extracts some
such coloring matter as caramel or tannin is used.</p>

<p><i>Preliminary Test.</i>&mdash;To a portion of the extract add a
few drops of lead acetate solution. The absence of a bulky
flocculent precipitate shows the extract not to be of high
quality. Leach recommends that normal acetate of lead
be added to the sample, and if a precipitate does not form
it is conclusive evidence that it is not a pure extract.</p>

<p>When a precipitate forms with the above reagent, it
should settle immediately and leave a clear and almost
colorless liquid. When there is a mere cloudiness only, it
may be due to caramel, in which case the extract is to be
suspected.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Alkali</span></h4>

<p>Shake a portion of the sample with twice its volume of
water. If no precipitate forms, an alkali is present. A
flocculent reddish-brown precipitate shows no alkali is
present. If the solution is milky it indicates the presence
of a foreign resin.</p>

<p>Add hydrochloric acid drop by drop to the diluted extract.
Nothing more than a mere turbidity should result. Should
it be quite turbid and the color fading after a time, it shows
that an alkali has been used.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Foreign Resins</span></h4>

<p>Mix a portion of the extract slowly with twice its volume
of water, frequently shaking the mixture. When this
solution is milky, it indicates a foreign resin.</p>

<p><i>Hess&#8217; Test.</i>&mdash;Dealcoholize 25 cc. of the sample by concentrating
on the water-bath, adding water from time to
time to retain the original volume. When no alkali is
present in the extract, pure vanilla resin will be thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
down as a reddish-brown flocculent precipitate. Collect
the resin, whatever its color, on a filter, and wash. Save
the filtrate to test for caramel. Place a piece of the paper
and resin in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxid. If the
resin is that of pure vanilla it will dissolve, giving a deep-red
color, and is reprecipitated when the alkali is neutralized
with hydrochloric acid. Dissolve another part of the
precipitate in alcohol, and to a part of this solution add
a few drops of ferric chlorid; and to the other part, hydrochloric
acid. There should be no marked coloration in
either case if the resin is that of pure vanilla. Foreign
resins nearly always produce a coloration.</p>

<h3>CARAMEL</h3>

<p>Shake the bottle of vanilla, and if the bubbles, which
form, are a bright caramel color, keeping the color till all
are gone, the presence of caramel is indicated.</p>

<p>Concentrate a portion of the filtrate, which was saved in
making the test for foreign resins, at a rather low temperature
until it has about the same color as the original extract.
Add a few drops of strong hydrochloric acid and heat very
gently. If caramel is present, a yellowish-red flocculent
precipitate will form. After the liquid cools, filter and
wash with water. Should this precipitate contain caramel,
it will not dissolve in water, ether, and alcohol, but will
dissolve in sodium hydroxid, dilute alcohol, and glacial
acetic acid.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tannin</span></h4>

<p>Test another portion of the filtrate made in testing for
foreign resins, with a few drops of a solution of gelatin. A
slight precipitate only should form due to the presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
small amount of tannin normally present in this filtrate.
A large excess shows that it has been added to the extract.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coumarin</span></h4>

<p><i>Leach&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Dealcoholize a portion of the sample as
above and treat with ammonia, add 3 or 4 volumes of
chloroform in a separatory funnel. Evaporate the chloroform
extract in an oven, not permitting the temperature to
rise above 60&deg; C. To the residue add a few drops of water;
warm gently, and add a little of a solution of 1 gram of crystallized
potassium iodid in 50 cc. of water, and the solution
saturated with iodin. If coumarin is present, a brown,
precipitate will form, and if stirred with a rod it will collect
in dark green flecks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="chapname">SACCHARINE PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<h3>HONEY</h3>

<p>Bees are sometimes fed with cane sugar. Often glucose
syrup is poured over honeycomb from which the honey has
been extracted, and the mixture sold as genuine honey.</p>

<p>Gelatin may be added to increase the weight or to thicken
the more voluble adulterants.</p>

<p>The ash of genuine honey is not over 0.3 per cent. Whenever
the ash is greater than this it should be tested for
calcium sulfate, the presence of a considerable quantity of
which is an almost certain proof that starch glucose or
invert sugar has been added to the honey. Sulfates may
be detected by adding barium chlorid to the aqueous solution
of the honey and precipitating barium sulfate.</p>

<p>If the ash is high and considerable chlorids are present,
molasses has quite probably been added to the honey. The
presence of chlorids may be determined by the addition of
silver nitrate which precipitates silver chlorid.</p>

<h3>CANE SUGAR</h3>

<p>The presence of cane sugar can be detected with certainty
only by the use of the polarimeter. Its presence in large
quantity gives a high right-handed rotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMMERCIAL GLUCOSE SYRUP</h3>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Make the test for dextrine which is
present in commercial glucose, but not in pure honey.
Dilute a portion of the honey with an equal volume of water
and add methyl alcohol with constant stirring until there is
a permanent turbidity. If glucose syrup is present a heavy
gummy precipitate will soon form. Genuine honey gives
only a slight milkiness.</p>

<h3>GELATIN</h3>

<p>Dilute a portion of the sample and add a solution of
tannic acid. A precipitate indicates the presence of gelatin.</p>

<p>Treat the sample with alcohol, and gelatin, if present,
will be left undissolved, and it will give its characteristic
odor on ignition.</p>

<h3>MAPLE SYRUP</h3>

<p>This is sometimes adulterated with glucose, molasses,
golden syrup, and with ordinary white sugar. There are no
satisfactory simple chemical tests for these substances.</p>

<p>Pure maple syrup should have an ash not lower than
0.35 to 0.40 per cent. A lower ash shows that cane sugar
has been added. A higher ash would indicate the presence
of molasses or brown sugar stock. These last two adulterants,
if present in great abundance, may be detected by
taste.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Glucose</span></h4>

<p>This may be detected by the use of the polarimeter. Pure
maple syrup gives 53.1 to 60 direct, and&mdash;22.2 to&mdash;21.9
after hydrolysis. Maple syrup adulterated with glucose
gives 80 to 100 direct and 18.9 to 45.6 after hydrolysis
(according to Ogdon).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="chapname">SPICES</span></h2>

<h3>MUSTARD</h3>

<p>Mustard is often adulterated with mustard hulls, wheat,
and rice. And when white-colored flour of any kind is
used, turmeric, Martius yellow, or a coal-tar color is employed
to give the mixture the color of mustard. Cayenne
pepper is occasionally used to impart pungency to diluted
mustard.</p>

<h3>FLOUR</h3>

<p>Boil 2 grams of the mustard in 4 or 5 cc. of distilled water
for about 10 minutes. After it is cool, add a few drops of
iodin solution slowly, avoiding a large excess though having
a little uncombined iodin. If a blue color is produced,
some starchy matter has been added to the mustard. The
intensity of the reaction is an indication of the amount of
starchy matter used. Pure mustard contains no starch
and hence gives no reaction with iodin.</p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER</h3>

<p>Pure mustard is a very light dull yellow, and whenever
the sample is bright yellow, there is good grounds for suspecting
the presence of some artificial coloring matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="SecRef08" id="SecRef08"></a><span class="smcap">Turmeric</span></h4>

<p>Add strong ammonium hydroxid to the mustard, and if
turmeric is present an orange-red color is usually produced.</p>

<p>Make an alcoholic extract of the sample and dip a piece
of filter paper in it, and when dry draw it through a cold,
saturated solution of boric acid in water. An orange or
red-brown tint produced on the paper indicates the presence
of turmeric.</p>

<p>Thoroughly mix 2 or 3 grams of the mustard with castor
oil and filter. If turmeric is present the filtrate will appear
fluorescent.</p>

<p>Extract a portion of the sample with 3 times its weight
of wood alcohol and filter. Evaporate one half of the solution
to dryness and add a little hydrochloric acid to the
residue. This will turn red whenever turmeric is present,
and if an excess of alkali be added it will change to a greenish
blue. Evaporate the other half to dryness and moisten
with a solution of boric acid and dry on a steam bath. A
cherry-red color indicates turmeric.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Martius Yellow or Analogous Coal-Tar Coloring
Matter</span></h4>

<p>Extract the slightly acidified sample with 95 per cent
alcohol and dye wool as <a href="#SecRef07">directed</a> under &#8220;Vegetables.&#8221;
The wool will be dyed a bright yellow.</p>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Treat a portion of the sample with cold
alcohol, and shake vigorously for 5 minutes, then filter and
evaporate the filtrate to dryness; add enough water to take
up the residue and dye some white wool in this liquid as in
the last test. When the dyed wool is wrapped in white
paper and heated to 120&deg; in an air bath, part of the coloring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
matter will be transferred to the paper. The coloring
matter dissolves readily in dilute ammonia or hot water,
and on the addition of hydrochloric acid the solution is
decolorized and a yellow precipitate formed. This distinguishes
it from picric acid.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cayenne Pepper</span></h4>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Boil 1 gram of the mustard for a few
minutes with alcohol, filter, and evaporate to dryness at
about 100&deg;. Taste the residue and cayenne may be recognized
by its pungency. Or heat a portion of the extract,
and smell the fumes. Irritation of the lungs and coughing
will surely follow if cayenne pepper is present.</p>

<h3>PEPPER</h3>

<p>Pepper may be adulterated with wheat, buckwheat,
pepper husks, ground olive stones, spent ginger. Cayenne
pepper is sometimes added to adulterated pepper to give it
the normal pungency. Many of these adulterants can be
detected only by the aid of the microscope.</p>

<p><i>Neuss&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;True pepper turns an intense yellow
when covered with strong hydrochloric acid. Any adulteration
can be detected at once by the color.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ground Olive Stones or &#8220;Poivrette"</span></h4>

<p>Make a paste of the pepper with caustic alkali. Dilute
with a large quantity of water and wash by decantation.
Olive stones will be colored a bright yellow; pepper-husks
will appear dark.</p>

<p><i>Jumeau&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 5 grams of iodin in a mixture
of 50 cc. of ether and 50 cc. of alcohol. Cover the bottom
of a porcelain capsule with the finely ground pepper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
add just enough of the iodin mixture to wet the entire mass,
and mix well till it has the same consistency throughout.
Let dry in the air, then powder and examine it, and if olive
stones are present they will be colored yellow. Pure
pepper would have a deep brown color.</p>

<p>Aniline acetate, one part aniline in 3 parts acetic acid,
colors pure pepper gray or white and olive stones yellowish
brown.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cayenne</span></h4>

<p>Heat some of the red particles found in the pepper and
their characteristic vapor is produced. Dissolve the particles
in alcohol or ether and the same vapors are produced.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="chapname">VINEGAR</span></h2>

<p>Vinegars may be adulterated by the addition of mineral
acids as sulfuric or hydrochloric. Caramel or the coal-tar
dyes may be employed to improve the color or to give color
to an artificial product. Malic acid is always present in
cider vinegar. Potassium acid tartrate occurs in true wine
vinegar. Poisonous metals may be present in vinegars
containing free mineral acid. Entirely artificial cider
vinegar is often found on the market.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Preparation of the Sample for Testing</span></h4>

<p>If the vinegar is turbid from any suspended matter, it
should be filtered. The samples should be analyzed at
once, and in the laboratory they should always be kept in
glass-stoppered bottles.</p>

<p><i>General Observations.</i>&mdash;Ignite a little of the vinegar
residue on a clean platinum wire in a colorless Bunsen
flame, and if it is pure cider vinegar the flame will be
colored the characteristic lilac color of potassium. The
sodium flame is absent or only a mere trace of it is present.
But in all artificially colored vinegars, spirit sugar and
glucose vinegars, the sodium flame predominates.</p>

<p>The residue of cider vinegar is thick, viscid, or mucilaginous,
of a light brown color, astringent acid taste though
not unpleasant. The solids of sugar-house vinegar, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from colored spirit and wood vinegar, each have a bitter
taste on account of the caramel used to color them. The
residue of the sugar-house vinegar has the odor of molasses.
Wood vinegar when present gives a residue with a tarry or
smoky taste and smell. Glucose vinegar gives the odor
of scorched corn. Solids of fruit vinegars are quite soluble
in alcohol, except a granular residue in grape vinegar,
while the solids of malt and glucose vinegars are almost
insoluble.</p>

<p>The ash of fruit vinegars and malt vinegars has a distinct
alkaline reaction, while that of spirit and wood vinegars
is very feebly alkaline.</p>

<h3>FREE MINERAL ACIDS</h3>

<p>The ash of pure cider vinegar is always alkaline. If a
vinegar should show a neutral reaction this would certainly
indicate the presence of a free mineral acid. If the ash be
alkaline, no acid except nitric could have been present, and
this is seldom, if ever, used as an adulterant of vinegar.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">When the Ash is Alkaline Apply</span></h4>

<p><i>Ashby&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Extract 0.5 gram of logwood in 100 cc.
of water and dry a drop or two on a porcelain surface. Then
add a drop of the vinegar and dry again. If the residue is
red, a mineral acid is present; if yellow, mineral acids are
absent. When only a very small amount of the acid is
present the red coloration will be destroyed on diluting with
water, but may be restored by concentrating the liquid.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sulfuric Acid</span></h4>

<p>Sulfuric acid, if present, will cause the vinegar to leave
a charred mass when evaporated over the water-bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Frear&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Mix 5 cc. of the sample and 5 or
10 cc. of water, and add a very little of a solution of methyl
violet (made by dissolving one part of methyl violet 2 B.
in 100,000 parts of water). A blue or green coloration
shows the presence of mineral acids.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sulfuric Acid as Distinguished from Sulfates</span></h4>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Evaporate 100 cc. of the vinegar down
to one tenth its volume, and when cold add 50 cc. of alcohol.
Sulfuric acid remains in solution while the sulfates are
precipitated. Dilute the solution and precipitate the acid
with barium chlorid.</p>

<h3>HYDROCHLORIC ACID</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Free</span></h4>

<p>Place a definite quantity of the vinegar in a distilling
flask and distil off half. Add a few drops of silver nitrate to
the distillate. If a precipitate forms, hydrochloric acid is
present.</p>

<h3>MALIC ACID</h3>

<p><i>Leach&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;To 5 cc. of the sample, add a few
drops of a solution of calcium chlorid (1&nbsp;: 10); make slightly
alkaline with ammonia. Filter off any precipitate that
may form, add 20 to 30 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol to the
filtrate and heat to boiling. If malic acid is present, a
voluminous flocculent precipitate will form. A precipitate
may form in vinegars containing dextrine. Make a further
test for malic acid by the following: Filter and treat the
precipitate with a little alcohol, and when dry add concentrated
nitric acid and evaporate to dryness on a water-bath.
Treat the residue with sodium carbonate, boil for a
short time, filter. Add acetic acid to the filtrate till slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
alkaline, boil till carbon dioxid is expelled, and if on the
addition of calcium sulfate a precipitate forms, it indicates
the presence of malic acid.</p>

<h3>COLORING MATTER</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Caramel</span></h4>

<p>The residue of vinegar to which much caramel has been
added has an unusually dark color and bitter taste.</p>

<p><i>Crampton and Simons&#8217; Method.</i>&mdash;Shake well together
in a corked flask 50 cc. of the vinegar with about half as
many grams of fullers&#8217; earth; after standing for half an hour
filter. Vinegar containing no artificial color will show
scarcely any change in color when thus treated. A caramel-colored
vinegar will be decolorized in proportion to the
amount of caramel present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coal-Tar Colors in Wine Vinegar</span></h4>

<p>Test by the usual test for coal-tar dyes. See under
canned vegetables.</p>

<h3>METALLIC IMPURITIES</h3>

<p>Vinegars containing free mineral acids are sometimes
found to contain poisonous metals.</p>

<p>Evaporate 200 to 400 cc. of the vinegar to dryness, add a
little sodium hydroxid to this residue and burn to an ash
over a low flame. It may be necessary to add a little potassium
nitrate once or twice. Add a little dilute hydrochloric
acid and saturate with hydrogen sulfid and test for
lead, zinc, copper, and arsenic according to <a href="#SecRef07">Allen&#8217;s method</a>
given under canned meats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Spices to Increase Pungency</span></h4>

<p><i>Leach.</i>&mdash;Neutralize a portion of the vinegar with sodium
carbonate. The presence of spices is easily detected by
tasting this mixture.</p>

<p><i>Another Test.</i>&mdash;Exactly neutralize a little of the vinegar
as above, evaporate to smaller bulk and taste as before,
then shake the concentrated liquid with ether, separate the
ethereal layer and evaporate it, and taste the residue.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tartar in Wine Vinegar</span></h4>

<p>The presence of tartar in vinegar proves it to be wine
vinegar.</p>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Evaporate a portion of the vinegar
and treat the residue with alcohol; a granular residue of
tartar remains undissolved. To prove that it is tartar,
decant the alcohol and dissolve the residue in a little hot
water, cool, rub the inside of the vessel with a glass rod, and
if tartar was present acid potassium tartrate will be deposited
where the rod touched the vessel. The test will be
more sensitive if an equal volume of alcohol is added.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Free Tartaric Acid in Wine Vinegar</span></h4>

<p><i>Test as for Tartar.</i>&mdash;Treat the alcoholic solution of the
extract with an alcoholic solution of potassium acetate.
Rub the sides of the vessel as before, and if tartaric acid is
present the streaks and sometimes a precipitate forms where
the rod touches the vessel.</p>

<h3>GLUCOSE</h3>

<p>Glucose is present when both direct and invert readings
are dextro-rotatory.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="chapname">FATS AND OILS</span></h2>

<h3>LARD</h3>

<p>Lard is very often adulterated with cottonseed oil,
cottonseed stearin and beef stearin. Their being very
much cheaper accounts for the sophistication.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cottonseed Oil</span></h4>

<p><i>Halphen&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 1 per cent of sulfur in a
given volume of carbon bisulfid. Add an equal volume of
amylic alcohol. Mix 3 to 5 cc. of this reagent with an
equal volume of the melted lard in a test tube. Close with
a cotton stopper and boil for 15 minutes in a bath of saturated
brine. The presence of cottonseed oil is indicated
by a deep-red or orange color, little or no color resulting in
its absence. Lard from hogs fed on any of the various
cottonseed products may give a faint reaction when this
test is applied.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cottonseed Stearin</span></h4>

<p>Since cottonseed stearin is only the more solid portions
of cottonseed oil, the above test may be applied, but to
distinguish it from the latter it is necessary to make determinations
quite beyond the scope of this set of tests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Beef-Stearin</span></h4>

<p>It is very difficult to identify beef-stearin by chemical tests.
It is usually detected by use of the microscope. Leach
gives the following method: Make a solution of 2 to 5 grams
of the fat in 10 to 20 cc. of ether. Let stand a half day,
at about the room temperature. Loosely stopper the tube
with cotton to prevent too rapid evaporation of the ether.
It is well to vary the conditions of heat, amount of solvent,
and rate of crystallization, to get the best possible results.
It may often be well to separate the crystals thus obtained
by filtering and recrystallizing from ether. Separate the
crystals that form at the bottom of the test tube from the
liquid portion by pouring on a small filter. Wash them
several times with ether, but not sufficient to remove the
mother liquor entirely. In case it is all removed, and the
crystals are too fragile to mount, add a drop of alcohol.
Crystals of lard stearin are flat rhomboidal plates, one end
being oblique to the sides, and they do not appear to be
regularly grouped. Beef-stearin crystals are rod-shaped,
or needles often apparently curved with pointed ends, and
are arranged in clusters like the ribs of a fan, the crystals
radiating from a common point. Under certain conditions
the lard crystals are not irregularly grouped, but are arranged
like the parts of a feather, where one part seems attached
to another close at hand. Considerable experience is necessary
to use this test with absolute certainty.</p>

<h3>OLIVE OIL</h3>

<p>Olive oil is one of the most commonly adulterated foods.
The commonest adulterant probably is cottonseed oil.
Other foreign oils, such as peanut, sesame, and rape, are
sometimes used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Preliminary Test.</i>&mdash;Pure olive oil turns from a pale to
a dark-green color in a few minutes, when it is shaken with
the same volume of concentrated nitric acid or sulfuric
acid. Whenever a reddish to an orange, or brown coloration
results, the presence of a foreign vegetable oil is indicated
(probably a seed oil).</p>

<p>Bach gives the following results of strong nitric acid on
the common oils. Olive oil when shaken with nitric acid
gives a pale green, which changes to an orange yellow after
heating five minutes. With similar treatment peanut oil
gives pale rose and brownish yellow; rape oil, pale rose and
orange yellow; sesame oil, white and brownish yellow;
sunflower oil, dirty white and reddish yellow; cottonseed
oil, yellowish brown and reddish brown; castor oil, pale
rose and golden yellow.</p>

<p><i>Pontet&#8217;s Test; Elaiden Test.</i>&mdash;Treat 1 cc. of mercury
with 12 cc. of cold nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and shake 2 cc.
of this freshly-made solution with 50 cc. of the sample in
a bottle every 10 minutes for 2 hours. Oils which are
principally olein, or mixtures of olein and solid esters like
palmatin and stearin, give more or less solid products, but
olive oil is remarkable for the firmness of the canary or
lemon-yellow mass which is formed. After standing a day
the mass cannot be pierced with a glass rod and sometimes
it gives forth a sound when struck.</p>

<p>This test requires considerable experience to be used with
any great degree of certainty.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cottonseed Oil</span></h4>

<p>Carbon bisulfid containing 1 per cent of sulfur in solution
is mixed with an equal amount of amyl alcohol. Equal
volumes (about 3 cc.) of this reagent and the sample, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mixed in a test tube, which is loosely stoppered with cotton,
and heated in a bath of boiling saturated brine for a quarter
of an hour. The presence of cottonseed oil is shown by the
formation of a deep-red or orange color. Little if any
color is produced in its absence. If no color is produced
it is well to add another cc. of the reagent and heat 5 or 10
minutes more, and to repeat this again if no color forms.
Lard and lard oil from animals fed on cottonseed meal
may give a faint reaction.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Peanut Oil (Arachis Oil)</span></h4>

<p><i>Bellier&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Saponify a gram of the sample with 5
cc. of a solution of 85 grams potassium hydroxid in a liter
of strong alcohol. This may be done in a small Erlenmeyer
flask on the water-bath. Then boil for two minutes,
neutralize exactly with dilute acetic acid (use phenolphthalein
as the indicator). Cool the mixture by placing the
flask in water at 17&deg; to 19&deg; C. A precipitate usually forms.
Add 50 cc. of 70 per cent alcohol which contains one per
cent by volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr.
1.2). Shake the flask vigorously and cool again as before.
If no precipitate forms the oil is not adulterated with peanut
oil. The presence of 10 per cent or more of peanut oil
produces a precipitate, even a smaller amount will produce
a cloudiness after standing between 17&deg; and 19&deg; C. for 30
minutes.</p>

<p>Some varieties of olive oil from Tunis give the same
turbidity when the 70 per cent alcohol is added. To distinguish
these from peanut oil heat the mixture on the
water-bath till everything has dissolved, and cool to 17&deg; to
19&deg;. The cloudiness will not appear if the oil is pure, but
will reappear if peanut oil is present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sesame Oil</span></h4>

<p><i>Badouin&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;About 0.1 of a gram of cane sugar is
dissolved in 10 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.20) shaken
vigorously with 20 grams of the sample for a minute or
more. After standing for a while the aqueous solution will
separate from the oil. If 1 per cent or more of sesame oil
is present, the aqueous solution will be colored crimson.</p>

<p><i>Tocher&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 1 gram of pyrogallic acid in
15 cc. of strong hydrochloric acid. Add an equal volume
of the oil in a separatory funnel. When it has stood a
minute, draw off the aqueous solution and boil. In the
presence of sesame oil it is colored red by transmitted light,
and blue by reflected light.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Rape Oil</span></h4>

<p><i>Palas&#8217; Test.</i>&mdash;Make a 1 per cent solution of fuchsin and
a 30 per cent solution of sodium acid sulfite. Mix together
20 cc. of each of these solutions and add 200 cc. of water
and 5 cc. of strong sulfuric acid. After the solution is
decolorized, 10 cc. of the sample is shaken with it. If rape
oil is present, the color will be partially restored. To
prevent the formation of the color by contact with the air
have the vessel full of the mixture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="chapname">BEVERAGES</span></h2>

<h3>COFFEE</h3>

<p>Coffee is often colored with such substances as Scheele&#8217;s
green, chrome yellow, iron oxide, Prussian blue, indigo and
turmeric. Imitation coffee beans have been made of wheat
flour, bran, rye, chicory and peas.</p>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Preliminary Test.</i>&mdash;A good preliminary test for
ground coffee is to sprinkle some of it on the surface of cold
water. The oil of true coffee prevents the particles from
being readily soaked, and so they float for some time.
Chicory and most of the other adulterants of coffee contain
no oil, but do contain caramel, which is quickly extracted
by the water producing a zone of brown color about such
particles. They become soaked and quickly sink. The
liquid containing pure coffee diffuses uniformly without
coloring the water to any perceptible degree. Chicory and
similar roots give a dark brown, turbid infusion. Roasted
cereals do not impart so distinct a color to water.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coloring Matter</span></h4>

<p>Shake the coffee beans in cold water and make the regular
qualitative tests for the inorganic coloring matters&mdash;Scheele&#8217;s
green may be identified by testing for copper and
arsenic; chrome yellow, by testing for lead chromate; iron
oxide may be detected by its characteristic tests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Organic coloring matter is best extracted with alcohol.
Prussian blue may be detected by dissolving it from the
sediment with hot caustic alkali, acidifying with hydrochloric
acid, treating it with a drop of ferric chlorid. If
present, ferric ferrocyanide, a blue precipitate, will be formed.
Indigo is not discharged by sodium hydroxid, while Prussian-blue
is. It will form a deep blue solution with sulfuric
acid.</p>

<p><a href="#SecRef08">Test for turmeric</a> as under mustard.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Imitation Coffee Beans</span></h4>

<p>Most imitation coffee, as already stated, is heavier than
water. Coffee contains no starch, so the imitation beans
made of cereals may be detected by testing for starch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Starch</span></h4>

<p><i>Allen&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;Boil the coffee in 10 parts of water.
When perfectly cold add to it a little sulfuric acid, then a
strong solution of potassium permanganate, drop by drop,
with constant shaking, till the liquid is almost decolorized;
strain or decant and add to the solution a solution of iodin.
If 1 per cent or more of starch is present, a blue coloration
will be produced.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chicory</span></h4>

<p><i>Rimmington&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Boil a portion of the sample with
water which contains a little sodium carbonate; decant,
wash and treat the residue with a weak solution of bleaching
powder for several hours. The solution will be decolorized.
The coffee will be at the bottom as a dark layer while the
chicory will be a light layer above it.</p>

<p><i>Albert Smith&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Boil 10 grams of the sample in
250 cc. of water; strain and add basic lead acetate in slight
excess. A precipitate forms, and when it has settled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
supernatant liquid will be colorless if the coffee is pure,
but more or less colored if chicory is present.</p>

<h3>TEA</h3>

<p>Tea is adulterated by the substitution of inferior grades for
those of better quality, by the addition of exhausted leaves
and foreign leaves, by the use of coloring matter or &#8220;facing&#8221;
such as Prussian blue, indigo, or turmeric to color green
tea, and sometimes graphite to color black tea. Foreign
astringents (generally catechu) are added to conceal the
presence of exhausted leaves. An imitation tea, &#8220;lie tea,&#8221;
is made of the stems and dust with mineral matter, and
some starch or gum to hold these together.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Foreign Leaves</span></h4>

<p>Though there are several chemical tests for foreign leaves,
none are as satisfactory as a microscopical examination.
Soften the leaves by soaking in hot water, unroll carefully
and examine with a hand lens or low power of the microscope.
Compare with a genuine leaf&mdash;the shape, margin,
and venation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exhausted Tea Leaves</span></h4>

<p>Sometimes such leaves may be detected by a physical
examination. They are often more or less unrolled and
broken on the edges. But the only certain way of ascertaining
their presence is to determine the soluble ash which
is from 2.5 to 4 per cent in pure tea and usually less than
0.8 per cent in exhausted tea.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lie Tea</span></h4>

<p>This imitation tea is easily detected by pouring hot water
over the leaves. If they are artificial, they will break down
into the fragments of which they were made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Facing</span></h4>

<p>Organic coloring matter may be detected by the same
method used for detecting such colors in coffee.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Catechu</span></h4>

<p><i>Hager&#8217;s Test.</i>&mdash;Boil a little of the tea in water, and add
to the extract an excess of lead monoxid. If the tea is pure
the addition of a solution of silver nitrate produces only a
slight grayish precipitate, but when catechu is present a
yellow flocculent precipitate forms.</p>
